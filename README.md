  This application is my first site using API calls, multiple pages, and a CSS framework (Materialize). It is a front-end site using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It makes API calls to an exercise API and a diet API to display a list of exercise and diet options, then displays a random exercise or recipe based on the user's selection.

  This was originally our first group project at the UCF coding bootcamp. I would like to thank my groupmates: Miles Wildmore, Emanuel Velazquez, and Ella Girin. After graduation from the bootcamp, I recreated the site in my own repo and made some modifications.
